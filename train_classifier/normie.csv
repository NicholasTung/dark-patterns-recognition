The 034Motorsport Adjustable Solid Rear Sway Bar is made from high-quality spring steel for maximum rigidity, and is designed to combat understeer while reducing body roll under hard cornering.",0
This product was tested thoroughly on the street and track on both the 034Motorsport Audi TT RS 2.5 TFSI and Nate@034's Audi A3 before release. The 034Motorsport Adjustable Solid Rear Sway Bar substantially reduces understeer and body roll on the Audi 8J/8P and MkV/MkVI Volkswagen R32 & Golf R without compromising comfort on the street.,0
"In addition, the 034Motorsport Rear Sway Bar is engineered to be used effectively with the stock front sway bar. No upgrade in the front is needed or required. The addition of a stiffer front bar introduces even more push, requiring an even bigger bar in the back.  With the stock front sway bar and upgraded 034Motorsport Solid Rear Sway Bar, body roll is virtually eliminated while turn in and off throttle oversteer are greatly improved.",0
"The sway bar rate is adjustable via the adjustment holes. The two holes closest to the MOI of the bar are the ""stiff"" (423% stiffer than stock) setting, and the two holes farther out are the ""soft"" (362% stiffer than stock) setting.",0

Great great product!!!’,1
"It is very hard finding a “me time” when you have a full time job and taking care of family. Having my 100% pure products esp my PM routine makes me feel special at least for a moment. This products does what it says. I have oily skin, i have been using this in the PM for about a week now, it is not tacky or sticky as i have discovered the perfect amount for my skin. My skin feels soft, healthy, plump and brighter. I highly recommend this product and i truly believe this company. I l",1

"OMGoodness! Heaven in a bottle! This goes on like pure silk. That's what my skin feels like after I put it on too. It has literally rejuvenated my 46 year old skin. It has brightened my skin from the inside out! Like a light is shining under my skin to create a soft glow. My pores are smaller, my discoloration is gone, and no breakouts! Fine lines and wrinkles are fading. It goes perfect under my moisturizer. And add makeup on top of that, no problem...it holds up beautifully. Absolute keeper!",1

I buy this stuff in bulk.,1
"This serum is great. When I use it consistently it changes the texture of my skin, making it very smooth and absolutely youthful. I can’t live without it. It smells fantastic too. My skin gets tiny bumps all over it because of natural oil production, but I notice that when I use this serum consistently along with my normal cleansing routine, it really helps with the texture. And it’s natural! Whenever there is a good sale, I buy a lot of these serums. I buy a LOT of their products in general, but this serum has been my favorite since day one. This brand is heaven.",1

"Magnesium is a key mineral contributing to performance and overall health alike. However, certain forms of magnesium often used in sports supplements are also potent laxatives. Transparent Labs ZMO utilizes Magnesium Bisglycinate which is a non-laxative form of magnesium, as well as one of the most bioavailable sources [1]",0

,0
"Compared to Zinc, Magnesium shows greater promise in positively effecting testosterone levels. A recent 2010 study found, that both sedentary and athletic males displayed increases in testosterone upon magnesium supplementation. The greatest increase was in athletic individuals, as exercise also increases testosterone. [2]",0

GENERAL HEALTH,0

Oyster Meat Powder,0
500 mg,0
"Oyster is often regarded as a potent aphrodisiac due to its naturally high zinc and magnesium concentrations. However, beyond Zinc and Magnesium are the more important trace minerals that act as co-enzymes in the body and maximize zinc and magnesium utilization.",0

"In addition to delivering a wide array of 59 trace minerals, Oyster Meat is also under investigation for increasing endurance [10], anti-oxidant activity [11], and immunity function in athletes [12].",0

This lotion is hypoallergenic and pH neutral, which makes it gentle, mild and non-irritating on the baby's skin. This also makes it ideal for daily use.",0

"We now have 6 Brother printers that run on these cartridges which we use for office printing, job tickets, memos etc.. These cartridges will not win any awards for the greatest print coverage, but they will save you a ton of money. We can buy a 5pack here for the price of 1 cartridge from a big-box store and free shipping always helps..",1
"So if you're planning on using these to print beautiful charcoal drawings, these may not be for you, but for normal printing these are great..",1

The shipping time was great and the product is always good. I have going to begin purchasing the Jumbo style of this toner as it is double the amount of copies and only $3.00 more in price. Wish I would have noticed sooner.,1

Can you install 18x10.5 on the front ?,1
"We would say no, some people may try this with spacers, but it is too large for the front, and spacers would put undue stress on the front axle. In addition, you would likely experience rubbing.",1

"i love the fact that it has a 3 inch lip with the concave design contrast. absolutely a great rear wheel paired with the fronts obviously, i am running 5/16 rear spacers to give a little more aggressive look but that’s just me!",1

Nice Wheel,1

"My wife purchased the Cape Towns for me for Christmas, after I finally got my suspension work done they were finally installed. I love the look and the ride quality is excellent. The only issue was one of the center caps on the staggered set was polished instead of silver but American Muscle took care of that in no time. If you order these without tires, make sure you let your tire installer know that the stainless steel lip is very soft, both my 18X10.5 rear wheels were damaged with dents by the installer during tire installation. Overall I love them.",1

"After owning several other Mustangs including 99 Cobra and a bunch of Fox body’s I finally decided it was time for a new car. One that would be reliable, fast, and be able to cruise with the AC on in the summer.  When the S550 platform came out I knew I had to have one.",1

"Expect more of the steamy eroticism and BDSM sex play that hooked readers on the first book of the wildly popular Fifty Shades series by E.L. James. In the second installment, the naïve Ana winds up back in the arms of wealthy older businessman Christian, and their bedroom antics continue to inflame women's fantasies and their sex lives: droves of women are coming into the stores looking for the toys inspired by the novels, so much so that we've put together a special kit called Fifty Shades of Grey Indulge Your Fantasies Kit for you to play with as you work your way through the trilogy.",1
